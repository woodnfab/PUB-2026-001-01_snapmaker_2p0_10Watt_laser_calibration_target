## Introduction

OpenSCAD model for a snapmaker 2.0 / 350T 10Watt laser calibration target.

I have bought a used snapmaker 2.0 printer. It was missing this calibration target. 

It's also possible to contact snapmaker support to get it as a spare part.

## Background

The OpenSCAD model is made with ChatGPT.

It also might be somewhat over-engineered. But it's also about learning OpenSCAD and how to design something with it. So the honeycomb pattern on the bottom is just for esthetics.
